# Compiler and Interpreter
# Used To Convert a High Level Language to a Low Level Language
# High Level Language => Human Readable Language (English Like Syntax)
# Low Level Language => Machine Readable Language (Binary (0's & 1's))

# Interpreter
# Python is an interpreted Programming Language

# Programming Languages that use interpreter are known as Scripting Languages.
# Ex: Python, JavaScript, PHP, Perl


"""
Compiler vs Interpreter:
Compiler
1. This translates the whole program into Binary.
2. There is a generation of intermediate file
3. Execution is Faster when compared to interpreter
4. All the errors will be displayed since the whole program is translated
5. More memory is required compared to interpreter.
6. More time for analysing the source code.
6. Ex: C, C++, Java

Interpreter
1. This translates line by line
2. There is no generation of intermediate file
3. Execution is slower when compared to compiler
4. Program execution stops at the first error.
5. Less memory is required compared to compiler
6. Less time for analysing the source code.
Ex: Python, JavaScript, PHP, Perl
